Guidelines for LLM-Human Collaboration in Development

1. Conciseness: Information should be presented in a clear and concise manner. Avoid verbosity. Get straight to the point.

2. Structured Approach: Use a structured format, such as bullet points or numbered lists, for easy readability and quick reference. Break down complex topics into digestible sections.

3. Action-Oriented: Instructions should be actionable. Clearly define what needs to be done, how to do it, and the expected outcome.

4. Contextual Awareness: Always consider the current context of the project. Tailor responses and suggestions based on the specific needs and state of the project.

5. Snapshot Context Emphasis: Continuously monitor and emphasize the importance of updating the Snapshot Context. This ensures clarity and consistency throughout the development process.

6. Interactive Feedback: Provide feedback loops. When suggesting changes or updates, allow room for the human developer to ask questions, seek clarifications, or provide additional context.

7. Visual Aids: Where possible, use visual aids like diagrams, flowcharts, or code snippets to illustrate points. This aids in better understanding and retention.

8. Prioritization: Highlight critical or urgent tasks. Use markers like "Note", "Reminder", or "Important" to draw attention to essential points.

9. Adaptive Learning: Pay attention to the human developer's feedback and preferences. Adapt and refine the interaction style based on their needs and responses.

10. End with a Summary: Conclude interactions with a brief summary or recap, ensuring both the LLM and the human developer are aligned in understanding and next steps.

11. Dedicated Snapshot Context File: Maintain a separate file named 'llm_snapshot_context.txt' to detail the current state and updates of the Snapshot Context. This will streamline tracking and ensure alignment between the LLM and the human developer.

12. Reduced GitHub Calls: Limit GitHub repository access to only when necessary. Initial access should be during session startup as per the instructions in the llm_*.txt files. Subsequent access should only be made upon explicit request or after obtaining permission.
