Engines:
PhysicsEngine: Replace placeholder logic with actual physics logic tailored to game requirements.
RuleEngine: Implement actual rule validation logic based on specific game requirements.
TrainingEngine: Implement data collection and preprocessing logic.
VisualizationEngine: Implement 2D and 3D visualization methods and enhance the VisualizeInConsole class for more detailed console visualizations.

Games:
BaseGame: Enhance the initialize_state, define_rules, and load_assets methods to provide more game-specific implementations.
DebugGame: Expand the debug checks for each engine to ensure comprehensive testing. Implement the finalize_game method to conclude the DebugGame.
GameOfLife: Integrate with the RuleEngine and PhysicsEngine for game state evaluations and simulations.
TicTacToe: Implement game-specific rules and rendering logic.

Main Application:
Enhance the core gameplay loop in main.py to include game logic, user input, and other necessary interactions.
Implement error handling mechanisms for potential issues during game initialization or selection.
Ensure seamless integration between game modules and engines.
