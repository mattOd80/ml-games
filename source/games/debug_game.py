"""
DebugGame Class:

Reason for Being:
- The DebugGame class is a specialized game designed to validate and debug the flow of games through the system.
- It acts as a diagnostic tool, ensuring that each engine is functioning correctly and that the flow through the system is as expected.

Use:
- Simulates interactions with each engine and logs the results, acting as a "preflight checklist" for the system.
- Provides a visual representation of the flow, highlighting any potential issues or gaps.
- Helps in quickly identifying and rectifying problems within the system.

Fit into the System:
- Inherits from the BaseGame class, ensuring it follows the standard game structure and interface.
- Acts as a first line of defense, ensuring that any new features, engines, or changes to the system do not introduce errors or disrupt the flow.
- Provides developers with a clear and concise log of the entire game flow, making debugging and validation more efficient.

Note: Developers should run DebugGame after making significant changes to the system or when introducing new engines or features to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
