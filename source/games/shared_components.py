SharedComponents:

Purpose:
- The SharedComponents module provides a collection of shared rules, actions, and physics methods that can be utilized across multiple games.
- It acts as a central repository for common functionalities, ensuring consistency, reusability, and maintainability across the system.

Key Features:
- **Shared Rules**: Define common game rules that can be applied across different games. This might include turn-based mechanics, win conditions, or boundary checks.
- **Shared Actions**: Standardize actions that players or the system can take, such as move, jump, or interact.
- **Shared Physics**: Offer basic physics simulations like gravity, collision, or momentum that can be reused in various game scenarios.

Future State and Integration with CNN:
- The design of SharedComponents is intended to be modular and extensible, allowing for future integration with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- In the envisioned future state, a trained CNN can utilize these shared components to influence many aspects of the game. This includes:
  - **Decision Making**: Using the shared rules to make informed decisions during gameplay.
  - **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipating player actions based on shared actions and influencing game outcomes.
  - **Dynamic Interactions**: Modifying or enhancing shared physics based on game state and player behavior.
- This integration aims to create a more adaptive and intelligent game environment, where the game can learn, adapt, and evolve based on player interactions and other inputs.

Implementation Status:
- While the current implementation contains placeholders, it's crucial to develop these shared components with the future integration of CNN in mind.
- Developers should ensure that the design remains modular, extensible, and compatible with machine learning models.

Note:
- As the system evolves, the SharedComponents module will play a pivotal role in bridging traditional game mechanics with advanced machine learning capabilities. It's essential to prioritize its development and ensure its alignment with the broader system goals.
