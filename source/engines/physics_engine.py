"""
PhysicsEngine:

Purpose:
- Simulates physical interactions within games.
- Provides methods to calculate and update game states based on physical rules.

Methods:
- simulate_physics(game_state): Simulates physical interactions based on the provided game state.

Expected Behavior:
- Given a game state, it should update the state based on defined physical rules and return the updated state.

Placeholder Logic:
- The current implementation is a placeholder. 
- TODO: Implement actual physics logic based on game requirements.
