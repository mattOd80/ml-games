RuleEngine:

Purpose:
- Evaluates game states based on defined game rules.
- Provides methods to validate moves and determine game outcomes.
- Manages game rules, decisions, and logic specific to each game.

Methods:
- validate_move(game_state, move): Validates a move based on the current game state.

Expected Behavior:
- Given a game state and a move, it should return whether the move is valid or not.

Placeholder Logic:
- The current implementation is a placeholder.
- TODO: Implement actual rule validation based on game requirements.
