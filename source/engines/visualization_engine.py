"""
VisualizationEngine:

Purpose:
- Provides visual representation of games.
- Contains classes for different visualization types, including console, 2D, and 3D.

Classes:
- Visualize2D: Provides 2D visual representation of games.
- Visualize3D: Provides 3D visual representation of games.

Expected Behavior:
- Given a game state, it should render a visual representation of the game.

Placeholder Logic:
- The current implementations for Visualize2D and Visualize3D are placeholders.
- TODO: Implement 2D and 3D visualization methods.
