# Human-LLM Collaboration Guide

Welcome to the Human-LLM Collaboration Guide for the ML Games project. This guide aims to streamline the collaboration process between human developers and the Language Learning Model (LLM).

## Introduction

The LLM is designed to assist, analyze, and report on the project's development. It operates based on a set of instructions provided in the `llm_*.txt` files. These instructions define the LLM's behavior, custom guidelines, and general development protocols.

## Why this Guide?

While the `llm_*.txt` files provide comprehensive instructions for the LLM, new developers might find it challenging to understand the LLM's operation initially. This guide serves as a brief overview to help developers get acquainted with the LLM's functionalities and collaboration process.

## Key Points:

1. **llm_*.txt Files**: These files contain specific instructions for the LLM. They guide the LLM's behavior, provide custom instructions tailored to the project, and offer general development guidelines.
2. **Snapshot Context**: The `llm_snapshot_context.txt` is crucial. It provides a snapshot of the project's current state, ensuring that both the LLM and the human developer remain aligned.
3. **Feedback Loop**: The LLM values iterative feedback. Developers are encouraged to provide feedback, ensuring that the LLM adapts and refines its interaction style based on their needs.
4. **Branch Management**: The LLM assists in managing branches based on the session's status and topic, ensuring an organized development process.

## Conclusion

Collaborating with the LLM can enhance the development process, offering insights, suggestions, and analysis. This guide aims to make the collaboration smoother and more intuitive for developers. For detailed instructions, always refer to the `llm_*.txt` files.

Happy Collaborating!
