Branch Name: feature_debug_game_integration
Session Topic: DebugGame Implementation and Engine Integration

Dynamic Game/Simulation System: ./readme.txt

Key Functions/Methods:
- load_game: Dynamically loads a game based on the provided game name.
- main: Core gameplay loop that involves evaluating game state, simulating physics, rendering visuals, and collecting data.

Primary Dependencies:
- BaseGame: Blueprint for game structures.
- RuleEngine: Evaluates game state based on rules.
- PhysicsEngine: Simulates physical interactions.
- VisualizationEngine: Provides visual representation of the game.
- TrainingEngine: Handles game data collection and processing.

TODO:
- Implement DebugGame to validate the flow of games through the system.
- Ensure DebugGame inherits from BaseGame and integrates with all engines.
- Replace placeholder checks in DebugGame with actual engine interactions.
- Test the flow of DebugGame and ensure it provides a comprehensive log of the entire process.

Reminder:
- Ensure concepts are sound and update placeholder code where required to reflect Dynamic Game/Simulation System.
- Always request the latest version of the file before analysis.
- Regularly update the Snapshot Context.

Note:
- LLM assists, analyzes, reports, and makes changes.
- Developer assists, analyzes, reports, and makes changes.
