Session Topic: Create MVP of the game loop

1. **Main.py Overview**:
   - Main.py acts as the hub for game flow and remains agnostic of the specific games.
   - Uses dynamic loading to load games based on user input or command-line arguments.
   - Integrates with various engines: RuleEngine, PhysicsEngine, VisualizationEngine, and TrainingEngine.

2. **DebugGame**:
   - Serves as a sandbox environment for testing and development.
   - Primary focus is to log the caller and the passed arguments, providing insights into the event flow through the engines.
   - Successfully integrated with Main.py for dynamic loading.

3. **Engines**:
   - RuleEngine: Evaluates the game state.
   - PhysicsEngine: Simulates physics. (Note: Ensure the 'simulate' method is defined and functional)
   - VisualizationEngine: Renders visuals.
   - TrainingEngine: Collects and processes game data.

4. **Issues & Resolutions**:
   - Encountered an issue with dynamically loading the DebugGame. Resolved by adjusting the module and class naming conventions.
   - Encountered an error related to the 'simulate' method in PhysicsEngine. Advised to check and define the method if missing.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Ensure all engines are functional and integrate seamlessly with DebugGame.
   - Expand on the DebugGame to include more functionalities and interactions.
   - Test the entire flow from Main.py to DebugGame and through the engines.
