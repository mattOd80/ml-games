Snapshot Context: main.py
Date: 2023-08-29
Status: In-Progress

Key Functions/Methods:
- load_game: Dynamically loads a game based on the provided game name.
- main: Core gameplay loop that orchestrates the game's flow, including rule evaluation, physics simulation, visualization, and data collection/processing.
- get_user_input (Not yet implemented): Expected to handle user interactions and game control mechanisms.

Primary Dependencies:
- BaseGame: Represents the base structure of a game.
- RuleEngine: Manages game rules, decisions, and logic specific to each game.
- PhysicsEngine: Simulates physical interactions, movements, and properties.
- VisualizationEngine: Provides a visual representation of the game.
- TrainingEngine: Collects, processes, and stores game data for training purposes.

TODO:
- Implement the get_user_input function to refine user input interactions and game control mechanisms.
- Expand the load_game function to support more games beyond just the BaseGame.
- Implement game logic, user input, and other necessary interactions within the main function.

Reminder:
- Ensure that user input error handling is in place.
- Always request the latest version of the file from the human developer before analysis.
- Prioritize updates to the Snapshot Context for clarity and consistency.

Note:
- LLM's primary role is to assist, analyze, and report. Direct changes are executed by the human developer.
