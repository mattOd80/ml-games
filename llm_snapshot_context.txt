Status: In-Progress
Branch Name: feature_debug_game_integration
Session Topic: DebugGame Implementation and Engine Integration

Key Functions/Methods:
- load_game: Dynamically loads a game based on the provided game name.
- main: Core gameplay loop.
- rule_engine_check: Simulates rule validations for DebugGame.
- physics_engine_check: Simulates physical interactions for DebugGame.
- visualization_engine_check: Provides visual feedback for DebugGame.
- training_engine_check: Simulates data collection and processing for DebugGame.

Primary Dependencies: BaseGame, RuleEngine, PhysicsEngine, VisualizationEngine, TrainingEngine.

Dev Flow:
1. Review the current state of `DebugGame` and identify placeholders and incomplete methods.
2. Integrate `DebugGame` with `BaseGame` to ensure foundational methods and attributes are inherited.
3. For each engine:
   a. Update the respective `*_engine_check` method in `DebugGame`.
   b. Test the updated `DebugGame` output in the console.
   c. Refine and iterate until the `DebugGame` has a single test for each engine that functions as expected.

TODOs:
- Complete the steps outlined in the Dev Flow.
- Further enhancements and refinements based on testing results.

Reminder: Update placeholder code, request the latest file version, update Snapshot Context regularly.

Note: Both LLM and Developer assist, analyze, report, and make changes.
